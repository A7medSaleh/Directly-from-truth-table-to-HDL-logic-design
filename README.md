This code helps you to automatically generate a VHDL code for your digital circuit which you can descripe directly by entering the truth table or writting the logic expression joining each output to the inputs finally you can directly draw the schematic of your circuit.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform. Also the GUI includes all tools to help you draw the schematic save and load projects
